The TLDR of the project is create a webserver with some api that also serves a website

static files will be fine for this
website and api server could be separate but that adds quite a bit of complexity and is not required

Needs to be in C# so ASP.NET would be the best option
While looking through the templates I saw this Aspire template, seems interesting but may add too much complexity and time if used for this

It would be nice to showcase the following skills:
CI/CD - possibly host using github website
Docker - can add build compexity vs a vs hosted app
Dependency Injection - ASP.NET has a DI framework

For the APIs RESTful API should suffice, refresh button for updates. If realtime data was required a websocket framework would be used

Adding a user login with the standard access and refresh tokens would be a nice way of showing security skills but that adds a lot of development time with setting up an authentication server etc...

Designing the project would be good, dependancy graph/api control flow

Unit tests are a must
